This program is a simple example of how to use Work Queue.  It estimates the
value of pi by estimating the ratio of the areas of a circle inscribed in a
square.

To run:

1. Install CCTools. For example, using conda:
conda create --yes --name work_queue_env python=3.8
conda install --yes --name work_queue_env install --channel=conda-forge ndcctools
conda activate work_queue_env

2. Execute (100 tasks sampling 1000 points each): python wq_pi.py 100 1000
3. Start workers, such as: work_queue_worker localhost 9123

This example assumes that the worker is executed inside a valid python
environment. (For example, that the conda environment work_queue_env or similar
is available at the worker's execution site.)
