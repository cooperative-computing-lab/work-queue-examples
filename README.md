# Work Queue Example Applications

This is a collection of examples of applications written using
the [Work Queue distributed application framework](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/workqueue/).

Briefly, a Work Queue application consists of a manager process that coordinates
a number of worker processes running in a remote cluster, cloud, or grid.
The manager dispatches a large number of tasks, each consisting of a command
line to execute, along with an explicit set of input and output files.
As tasks complete, the manager may generate more in response.
The number of workers may scale up or down (or fail and recover)
as the application runs.

The [Work Queue API](http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/manuals/api/html/work__queue_8h.html)
is available in Python, Perl, and C, and so these
applications are written in various different styles and languages.
Some require specific external programs to be installed.

Python Applications:
- wq_bwa - Distributed implementation of the Burroughs-Wheeler Algorithm (BWA) genome search tool.
- wq_diffusion - Distributed simulation of Brownian motion.
- wq_ensemble - Remote native python function evaluation as Work Queue tasks.
- wq_pi - Estimate the value of pi with distributed sampling.
- wq_repex - Distributed implementation of replica exchange algorithm using the Protomol molecular dynamics system.

C Applications:
- wq_sort - Sorts large datasets via distributed merge sort.
- wq_allpairs - Computes very large scale Cartesian products on large datasets.
- wq_wavefront - Computes very large scale wavefront problems, such as dynamic programming.
- wq_sand - Parallelizes the Celera assembler in two stages: candidate selection and alignment.

Perl Applications:
- wq_maker - Distributed implementation of the MAKER genome annotation toolkit.
- wq_bowtie - Distributed implementation of the BOWTIE genomic search tool.
